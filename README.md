# MKS-Robin-Nano-Firmware
Include Nano-firmware-v2.x.x and Nano-firmware-v1.x.x, can run on MKS Robin Nano V1.x motherboard(Not support Robin Nano V2.x).
As the IAR Embedded Workbench is not free, this PR will be ignored slowly. Now we mainly promote the Marlin V2.x firmware: [https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Mks-Robin-Nano-Marlin2.0-Firmware)
## Nano-firmware-v2.x.x
- Parameters are set directly through the screen
- After the parameter is set, it will work directly without restarting
- More suitable for DIY users
## Nano-firmware-v1.x.x
- Parameters are configured using config.txt
- Need to power off and restart for the parameters to be effective
- More suitable for 3D printer manufacturers and users who often do not modify parameters
